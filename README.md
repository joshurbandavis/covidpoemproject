## Introduction

Welcome to **The Night Air**, a unique website that invites visitors to embark on a collaborative poetic journey. In the spirit of creativity and connection, this platform allows users to co-create poetry with others, aided by a generative algorithm. 

**The Night Air** was born during the challenging days of the COVID-19 lockdown, with the goal of fostering a sense of togetherness and artistic expression during a time of isolation. The project received invaluable support from generous grants provided by the **Houston Arts Alliance**, **Art League Texas**, and the **Texas Council for the Arts**.
